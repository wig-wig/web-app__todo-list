# This controller is for all the CRUD operations related to a Login.

# Note that "logins" are not stored in the database. But there is still
# a reasonable way to think about a "login" as a resource which is created
# and deleted (i.e. 'logging out').
# 
# Reading and Updating a login, however, make a little less sense.
